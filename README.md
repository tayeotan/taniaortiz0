## 🐍 Python Projects 

[**Loan Approval Prediction Model**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/Loan_Approval_Prediction_Model)

#### Tools:
- Python
- Pandas / NumPy – Data preprocessing and handling categorical variables.
- Scikit-learn – Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, evaluation metrics.
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data exploration and visualization of results.

#### Keynotes: 
- Applied data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling).
- Built and compared models such as:
  - Logistic Regression (baseline model).
  - Decision Tree Classifier.
  - Random Forest Classifier.

- Evaluated performance with metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix

- Visualized model results and feature importance to interpret decision-making factors.


[**Payments Fraud Detection**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/Payments_Fraud_Detection)

#### Tools:
- Python
- Pandas / NumPy – Data preprocessing and feature transformation.
- Scikit-learn – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, evaluation metrics.
- XGBoost – Gradient boosting classifier for fraud detection.
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization (class distribution, feature analysis, confusion matrix).

#### Keynotes: 
- Preprocessed payment transaction data, handling missing values and categorical encoding.
- Built and compared classification models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Evaluated models using metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC score

- Visualized fraud detection insights:
  - Transaction amount distributions (fraud vs. legitimate).
  - Correlation heatmaps of features.
  - Feature importance ranking for fraud prediction.
  - Confusion matrices for model performance interpretation.


[**Geospatial Image Processing and Visualization**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/GeoData-IP-Visual)

#### Tools: Python Libraries (xarray, matplotlib, numpy, netCDF4)

#### Keynotes:

•	Gathered NetCDF4 files (scientific data) and was imaged processed by using Python and its libraries. 

•	Numpy was utilized for numerical computing with arrays and matrices.

•	Matplotlib was used for 3D visualization and plots to have a display of the radargram. 

•	NetCDF4 which allows you to read and write NetCDF files in Python.

•	Xarray for working with labeled multi-dimensional arrays.

[**COVID-19 and Unemployment Rate Analytics**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/COVID-19-UER-Analytics)

#### Tools: Excel, Python Libraries (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly)

#### Keynotes:

• Cleaned and structured 141 monthly observations from .xlsx format.

• Filtered and segmented data by country to track timeline-specific trends.

• Used Plotly and Seaborn to build both interactive and static charts.

• Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to quantify relationships.

• Identified weak to moderate correlations between COVID-19 surges and labor market fluctations.

• Clearly communicated insights using well-annotated graphs and written interpretation.

## 🔒 Cybersecurity & SOC Analyst Projects

 [**SIEM Simulation with Microsoft Azure + Honeypot**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/SIEM-Simulation-with-Microsoft-Azure)

##### Tools: Microsoft Azure Services (Resource group, Log Analytics Workspace, Windows 10 VM, Virtual network, Network security group)

##### Keynotes:

•	Virtual Machine will act as a honeypot allowing all unsecure ports open for incoming traffic.

•	Firewall configurations were made through connection via RDP for allowing all unsecure ports.

•	Created Microsoft Sentinel workspace and installed Data Connectors (Security Events via Legacy Agent and Windows Security Events via AMA).

•	Created a Log Analytics workspace and a data collection rule to forward logs.

•	Kusto Query Language (KQL) was utilized to view Security Events using parameters/filters.

•	GeoIP Data was utilized to display a Live-Attack map to view incoming/outcoming traffic.


[**SIEM, Network Forensics, & Incident Response Home Lab**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/SIEM-NF-IR-Home-Lab)

##### Tools: VmWare Workstation Pro17, Ubuntu, REMNux, Cloudflare, Splunk

##### Keynotes: 

• Created an isolated environment to analyze security incidents and malware.

• Configured Splunk on Ubuntu to analyze security incidents utilizing sample data from Splunk BOSS of the SOC (version 3).

• Setup Remnux and utilized the tool for malware analysis to analyze malicious software.

• Configured Cloudflare on Windows 11 to conduct network forensics and monitoring.

## 🗄️ Windows Active Directory Projects

[**Active Directory Home Lab**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/Active-Directory-Home-Lab)

##### Tools: VMWare Workstation Pro 17, PowerShell, Windows 11, Windows Server 2022

##### Keynotes:

•	Configured Windows Server 2022 as the Domain Controller (DC) for the two NICs (Internet and Internal). 

•	Utilized different services (Active Directory Domain Services, Remote Access Server, DHCP Server, DNS). 

•	Created a domain and admin account to administer 1000+ users (Users were created using a PowerShell script).

•	Configured Windows 11 as the Client to act as a private-internal network through DC.
